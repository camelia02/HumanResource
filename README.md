# HumanResource
Developing a human resource management system using SQL Server 2019 as our database. A practice to create a complete application for begginers
as in me, the student.

I just realised the database can only be used by me since I'm the author but I'll try using cloud on Azure if their are other's wanting to try developing this project 
with me. You can do a pull request if you want.
